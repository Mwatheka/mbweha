        <h2>Mbweha Camp Information</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Mbweha Camp</b> is one of the most popular <b>Lake Nakuru Park camps</b> due to its proximity to this famous attraction as well its beautiful cottages with contemporary African ambiance, Mbweha Camp is located about two hours’ drive from Nairobi, location makes <b>Mbweha Camp</b> an ideal base for a variety of exciting activities in Nakuru. For example, guided bush walks, game drives and tours of Lake Nakuru and <b>Lake Elementeita. </b> Most visitors will arrive by road, down the fast and wide 'Pipeline Road' from Nakuru town to the small rural crossroads community of Elementeita. All these rolling plains between lakes Nakuru and Elmenteita, and further south to <b>Lake Naivasha</b> – traditionally the grazing lands of local Maasai clans – were acquired by Hugh Cholmondeley (known as Lord Delamere) in the early years of the twentieth century, a total of more than 600 square kilometres that allowed his family to become the richest landholder in Kenya at the time, and Delamere himself to become the unofficial voice of European settlers. Today, most locals work on and among the Delamere properties. From Elmenteita village, you enter the western sector of the Soysambu conservancy (there's a gate) and drive 5km across the plains among scatterings of gazelle and zebra to a fringe of woodland marking the (fenced) boundary of Lake Nakuru National Park (you can often see colobus monkeys in the trees). Crossing the end of the grassy Congreve Airstrip, where warthog keep watch, you enter the unfenced Mbweha Camp (‘Jackal Camp’), marked by a garden of planted trees and natural, cactus-like euphorbias. The central bar-lounge-reception is set in a slight depression, accessed by short steps, under a circular thatched roof. There's comfortable seating down here and a circular fireplace. The rather featureless dining area is nearby. Outside the dining room, lawns spread to the well-maintained swimming pool, which has shade and loungers, but no life guard. The ten <b>guest rooms</b> at Mbweha Camp, each named after an animal, are circular, thatched bandas, built of lava stone, with polished, light cement floors. They have a small veranda area at the front. Inside, a double bed and single bed, with full-height mosquito nets, occupy most of the space, along with a small sofa and clothes storage shelves. The UK-style 3-pin sockets are available to charge from 6-9am, from 12.30-1.30pm and from 6-11pm. Behind the beds, a dividing wall separates the bedroom from the open-plan <b>bathroom</b>, which has a flush loo and a shower with plenty of hot water at good pressure, a rather impractical towel rack and a narrow wooden plinth for the twin, steel wash basins and single mixer tap. Good Cinnabar & Green toiletries are provided. Through a door to the side of the cottage, there's an incongruous-looking outdoor bathtub, screened by barely private fencing. Activities at <b>Mbweha Lodge</b> include short <b>bush walks</b> around the camp and guided bike rides in the western (lion-free) part of the Soysambu Conservancy, <b>Mbweha camp</b> also offers massage,  Mbweha Camp has one open-sided <b>Land Cruiser</b> based at safari camp for shared game drives for guests staying on a full board and activities basis, the 4x4 Landcruiser vehicle is equipped with charging sockets, in some instances we have some guests will be staying on a full board basis, not including activities with their drives conducted in a private vehicle by their own private driver-guide, as part of a road itinerary. The <b>Lake Nakuru National Park</b> Nderit Gate is about 20 minutes' drive from camp: in less than half an hour your game-driving in a very wildlife-rich environment, which also tends to mean it's usually very busy with visitors. While Lake Nakuru is the preferred feeding ground for hundreds of thousands of <b>lesser flamingos</b> as serious flooding changed the lake's ecology after 2012, the park is still home to some serious megafauna, and the plains and woods that surround the lake are home to lions, white rhinos, black rhinos, leopards, buffalo and plenty of plains grazers and browses, from zebras to hippos and from dik-diks to giraffes (they have the rare Rothschild giraffe here). The western part of <b>Soysambu Conservancy</b>, west of the Pipeline Road, is known as the <b>Congreve Conservancy</b> and this 25km² area is reckoned to free of dangerous wildlife and safe for walks and bike rides. East of Pipeline Road, you enter the much larger eastern part of the 190km² Soysambu Conservancy proper, which as well as providing grazing to the ranch's <b>livestock, </b> is home to lions, leopards and plenty of buffalo, though not elephants. Guides will point out the hill formations known as the 'Sleeping Warrior' and 'Delamere's Nose'. You have a very good chance of seeing some of <b>Soysambu's lions,</b> which are breeding and gradually sorting into two or three separate prides, numbering a total of at least 14 cats. Down near the shore of Lake Elmenteita, you'll see <b>lesser flamingos</b> in their thousands, standing in the foam-flecked shallows of this soda lake – though not in the numbers you can witness at Lake Bogoria. On our visit in 2018 we saw a leopard lurking in the bush near the lakeshore and briefly followed it - but this was an unusual bit of luck.

        <h2>Soysambu Conservancy   </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Soysambu Conservancy was created in 2007 as an entity to conserve the flora, fauna and scenery of <b>Soysambu Ranch</b>, which is to the northwest of Gilgil, Rift Valley Province, Kenya <b>Soysambu Conservancy</b> has taken a conservation lease over the ranch, which would be the portal to the proposed <b>Nakuru-Naivasha</b> wildlife corridor. The <b>Soysambu Conservancy</b> is 48,000 acres (190 km2) and borders the Elmenteita Badlands in the south in the area around Mawe Mbili. On the west it shares a boundary of 12.1 km with Lake Nakuru National Park. Soysambu, including <b>Lake Elementaita, </b> is a 48,000-acre wildlife conservancy, and also a RAMSAR site – a wetland of international importance. The alkaline lake’s rocky islands are the only East African nesting site for great white pelicans, while its algae and plankton provide food for vast flocks of flamingos and a multitude of other waterfowl, many of them rare. Soysambu Conservancy protects over 450 bird species and 15,000 wild animals. <b>Rothschild giraffes</b> have found a safe haven for breeding here, while a diverse variety of terrain shelters many species – from herds of giant elands to tiny dik-diks and cliff-dwelling klipspringers. Night game-drives are allowed in this area, offering a unique opportunity to spot nocturnal creatures including the curious-looking aardvark and elusive leopard. Walking is also allowed, with chances to experience the miracles of the bush close-up.

        <h2><h2>Directions  </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          <b>Mbweha Camp</b> is located at the western end of the <b>Soysambu Conservancy, </b> part of the privately owned Delamere Estate. The nearest airstrip is <b>Congreve Airstrip</b>, just two minutes from camp, which normally only receives private charter flights. The nearest airstrip for scheduled flights is <b>Loldia Airstrip</b> at <b>Lake Naivasha</b>, about 1 hour's drive away. Nakuru town, and the main A104 highway across the Rift Valley are about 30 minutes’ drive to the north. The southeastern Nderit Gate of Lake Nakuru National Park is about 20 minutes’ drive from camp.            </p>
        
          <h2>Soysambu </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Soysambu Ranch has been farmed by Lord Delamere's family since it was founded in 1906. The current operations include a large beef herd, a hay baling operation and an Agri-forestry enterprise among others. The owners had always cherished wildlife but had found the cost of securing it exorbitant. This partnership will enshrine public access, best management practices and provide a new business model for everyone in the area to benefit from. This is not so much of a lease as a complete paradigm shift for a previously privately operated agricultural enterprise. We hope you enjoy your stay and appreciate the wildlife and scenery here on Soysambu Conservancy. As a visitor, you have been given access to a delicate wildlife area. Care and attention is required if damage and disturbance to the environment is to be avoided.
          Lake Elmenteita and the surrounding lakeshore are a National Wildlife Sanctuary, World Heritage Site, Ramsar Site and Important Bird Area. Please respect the international guidelines governing these designations.

        <h2>When To Visit </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
              Visiting Soysambu Conservancy is great throughout the year. Kenya is known as a “year-round destination” which can be visited anytime. We are located 30 miles south of the equator at an elevation of 6000 feet, so the sun rises and sets pretty much the same time every day from 7am to 7pm. The days are long, offering many photographic opportunities and time for activities. 
              The temperature generally ranges between 50˚F (10˚C) and 75˚F (23˚C) either a little warmer during the dry season or cooler after the wet season. Be sure to bring a sweater or fleece as it can be very cool during the early morning and evening game drives. To plan your trip you should consider the seasons. It is either dry or wet with a transitional period in between. Enjoy a leisurely horse ride on Soysambu Conservancy while absorbing the stunning views of Lake Elmenteita and the Sleeping Warrior Crater. Horse Rides can suit any level of ability and guests are provided with a helmet. Rides are always accompanied by an experienced rider guide.
